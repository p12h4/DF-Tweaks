# "Discontinued Feature": What is it?

A discontinued feature is something that was obtainable in an older version of Minecraft but was changed or made unobtainable in later versions. This can range from mobs whose max health is higher/lower than normal to items or blocks with otherwise unobtainable properties/block states. This pack aims to make these discontinued features more distinguishable from their normal counterparts, making them easier to find and showcase in a world.
